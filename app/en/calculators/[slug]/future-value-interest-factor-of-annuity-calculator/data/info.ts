  description:
    "Focuses on the Future Value Interest Factor of Annuity (FVIFA), a financial metric used to determine the future worth of a series of equal, regular payments (an annuity) when earning compound interest. This resource defines FVIFA, differentiating it from the single-sum FVIF, presents the calculation formula FVIFA = [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] / r, guides users on operating the included interactive calculator by inputting the interest rate and number of periods, and addresses frequent questions about applying the factor to payment amounts, its behavior with zero or variable interest rates, and its core differences from FVIF.",
