    "This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for calculating the Future Value Interest Factor of Annuity (FVIFA) using Microsoft Excel, essential for determining the future worth of regular investments or payments. It defines FVIFA's role in compounding growth for annuities, presents the underlying mathematical formula FVIFA = [ (1 + r)^n - 1 ] / r, and details the practical Excel process including cell setup for interest rate (r) and number of periods (n), inputting the correct Excel formula to compute the FVIFA factor, and optionally applying this factor to calculate the total future value of a specific annuity stream.",
