  description:
    "A resource featuring a Future Value Interest Factor of Annuity (FVIFA) table, designed to simplify the calculation of the future value for a series of equal, regular payments earning compound interest. This page defines FVIFA, presents its underlying mathematical formula, but primarily focuses on providing and explaining the use of the lookup table where factors are indexed by interest rate (r) and number of periods (n). Includes clear instructions and an example on how to locate the appropriate FVIFA factor in the table and apply it to a specific periodic payment amount to find the total future value, along with frequently asked questions addressing rates/periods not listed and adjustments for monthly payments.",
